## Vendor Performance Analysis using Python , SQL and Power BI

## Overview
This project analyzes vendor sales data to understand how different vendors are performing.  
The main goal is to identify strong and weak vendors, observe sales trends, and generate useful insights that can help in better business decision-making.

The analysis is done using Python for data processing and Power BI for visualization.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains vendor sales information such as:
- Vendor name
- Sales values
- Transaction details
- Performance-related metrics  

This data is used to compare vendor performance and generate summaries.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Ingestion**  
   Raw data from CSV files is loaded into a database using Python.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   Missing and inconsistent values are handled to prepare clean data for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Sales patterns and vendor behavior are analyzed using charts and graphs.

4. **Vendor Summary Generation**  
   A Python script creates vendor-wise performance summaries.

5. **Dashboard Creation**  
   An interactive Power BI dashboard is built to visualize vendor performance clearly.

6. **Final Report**  
   A PDF report summarizes the insights and key findings.

---

## Key Insights
- Vendors with the highest and lowest sales are identified  
- Overall sales distribution is analyzed  
- Performance differences between vendors are highlighted  
- Data-driven insights are provided for better decisions
